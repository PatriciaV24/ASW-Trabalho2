/**
 * The current status of a single puzzle's piece. The piece is identified by an
 * integer, and has and a block, a position, rotation. A block is a set of
 * connected pieces When the puzzle's pieces are scattered each piece is in a
 * block containing a single piece. When 2 pieces are connected they become part
 * of the same block, as well as the other pieces belonging to their previous
 * blocks. Connected pieces - belonging to the same block - are moved together.
 * The position of a piece is determined by it's center. The center corresponds
 * to a point in the panel of PuzzleStructure. At any moment, the piece's
 * visualization is completely determined by its position and rotation.
 * Depending of the puzzle's features, a piece may be able to rotate. Simple
 * puzzles don't allow rotation. If rotated, a piece can only be connected to
 * another piece with the same rotation. When a piece is rotated, all pieces in
 * the same block are updated to the same angle.
