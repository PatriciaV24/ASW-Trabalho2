/**
 * Representation of the boundary if a piece as an initial Point followed by by a list of Segment. 
 * This is an abstraction of a path as available in several graphic packages, such as java.awt.geom or HTML Canvas.
 * For each piece, the origin of the coordinates is its geometric center. 
 * Hence, two pieces with the same shape have the same boundary representation. 
 * This approach enables piece positioning using translations. The coordinate system is simply translated to the point where the piece must be positioned and then it is drawn using this representation.
 * Shapes are typically created using chaining using addSegment(Segment).
 * This method returns the instance itself and thus can be used as context to another invocation of the same method.
